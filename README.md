# Rex-PHP

## Real Estate eXplorer - Made using PHP

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
PHP Server (can be use XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP etc)
MySQL Database Server (not needed if using XAMPP, WAMP etc)
Apache httpd Server (not needed if using XAMPP, WAMP etc)
A Web Browser
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Extract the downloaded zip in a particular folder.
Place these files to htdocs in case of XAMPP. In case of WAMP place it in www folder of WAMP installation folder else start php and MySQL services manually for that folder.
Open WAMP, XAMPP Control Panel if available.

After getting things ready open Apache and MySQL from WAMP, XAMPP Control Panel if available.

After that open localhost/phpmyadmin in browser and import file of ./sql/rex.sql from downloaded zip if you are using any server Manager app like XAMPP, WAMP else start MySQL service from MySQL server and open above url and follow further step that for importing sql file.

Then finally, Run the server and listen to particular port in which it is served i.e. localhost:80
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Deployment

For deployment you need register yourself with any of the apache http server provider like 000webhost.com, Heroku, Firebase, Amazon AWS etc.
In my case, I am using 000webhost.com which is free for student.
